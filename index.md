<h1 class="h1.header">TaPP 2024</h1>

The Theory and Practice of Provenance workshop series was started in San Francisco in 2009. 
TaPP aims to be a venue for early-stage and innovative research ideas related to provenance, 
and a forum to encourage exchange of ideas between researchers working on provenance and 
practitioners or potential users of such research. 
Industry and academic participants interested in provenance in any setting are welcome, 
and workshop contributions describing unsolved problems or new potential application areas for provenance research are particularly welcome.

<h2 class="h2.header">Call for Papers</h2>
TaPP 2024 inherits the tradition of providing a genuine workshop environment for discussing and developing new ideas and exploring connections between disciplines and between academic research on provenance and practical applications. We particularly welcome submissions covering security-related topics this year but continue to support diverse conversations from all disciplines, bringing together researchers from a wide range of computer science domains including workflows, databases, high performance computing, distributed systems, operating systems, programming languages, and software engineering, that have urgent provenance needs. Submission topics reflect the cross-cutting nature of this field, including, but not limited to:
- Trust, transparency, and accountability
    - Provenance and trustworthy systems
    - Provenance to support accountability and transparency
- Deployability, security, and forensic capabilities of provenance capture
    - Standardization of provenance models and representations
    - Retroactive reconstruction of provenance
    - Integrating provenance information
- Storage and query efficiency
    - Analytics, querying, and reasoning about provenance
    - Performance aspects of provenance capture, storage, and analytics
- Accuracy, performance, and explainability of provenance analysis
    - Security and privacy implications of provenance 
    - Visualizing provenance information
    - Human interaction with provenance
- Dataset and evaluation
    - Generating provenance datasets and comparing provenance-based security solutions
